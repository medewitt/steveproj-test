# A README for This Project

Thank you for choosing [`{steveproj}`](https://github.com/svmiller/steveproj) for your academic paper/project in the R programming language. You had many options to select to assist you in your research, and you selected this template from a hopelessly vain and self-interested political scientist. No matter the vanity and weirdness of its creator, this package should do well to facilitate your research around the R programming language in an intuitive, flexible, and reproducible way.[*]


[*]: [`{steveproj}`](https://github.com/svmiller/steveproj) comes with everything you see here. Batteries not included. Warning: pregnant women, the elderly, and children under 10 should avoid prolonged exposure to `{steveproj}`. Do not taunt `{steveproj}`.
